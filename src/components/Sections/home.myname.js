            I'm your new social media bestie. My mission is to help small and
            medium-sized businesses grow their audience and brand recognition
            through social media. To do that, I believe it's paramount to create

            peopleâ€™s lives beyond the online sphere. My goal is to help you
            understand the power of social media and create connections that go
            beyond the internet.
